Exercise 1: Creating Variables and Printing

For you to do:
Create a new BlueJ project called “BooleanPractice” and create the appropriate class file as well
In your class file, create a boolean variable called “isTrue” and set it to false
Create a double variable called “money” and set it to 9999.99
Using your variables, print a statement to the screen that reads “The rumor of the CS department at HHS having a classroom budget of 9999.99 is false.”
On the next line, print a statement to the screen that reads “The CS classrooms wish they had a classroom budget of 9999.99 so they could buy all sorts of gadgets and computer “stuff” to help them learn.”
